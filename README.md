# INSERT GAME NAME HERE

INSERT GAME NAME HERE is an endless survival Virtual Reality game. When the game is loaded up you start in an environment where you are faced by a bow stand. Your first objective is to teleport to the bow stand and pick up the bow. After the bow is picked up, you are able to shoot the target that is in front of you. Shooting this target will start the spawning of various enemies, as well as a timer that counts up. Use the bow that you picked up to neutralize the enemies in game. Survive as long as you can!
